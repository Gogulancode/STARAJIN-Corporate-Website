/**
 * TRANSLATION DUPLICATE KEY FIX SUMMARY
 * Fixed: September 7, 2025
 * 
 * üîß ISSUE RESOLVED:
 * ESBuild was showing "Duplicate key" warnings for the following keys in translations.ts:
 * - "b2bPartner" 
 * - "strategyConsultation"
 * - "businessData" 
 * - "investment"
 * 
 * üîç ROOT CAUSE:
 * The services section had both flat string keys and nested object keys with the same names:
 * 
 * BEFORE (Problematic):
 * ```typescript
 * services: {
 *   investment: "Alternative Investment Advisory",        // ‚ùå Flat key
 *   investmentDesc: "Expert advice...",
 *   b2bPartner: "B2B Partner",                          // ‚ùå Flat key  
 *   b2bPartnerDesc: "M&A...",
 *   // ... later in same object:
 *   investment: {                                        // ‚ùå Duplicate key!
 *     title: "Leaning into India's investment...",
 *     description: "Strategic portfolio..."
 *   },
 *   b2bPartner: {                                        // ‚ùå Duplicate key!
 *     title: "B2B Partnership is riding high...",
 *     description: "M&A and technology..."
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * üõ†Ô∏è SOLUTION APPLIED:
 * Removed the flat string keys that conflicted with nested objects:
 * 
 * AFTER (Fixed):
 * ```typescript
 * services: {
 *   // Removed conflicting flat keys:
 *   // investment: "Alternative Investment Advisory",     // ‚ùå REMOVED
 *   // investmentDesc: "Expert advice...",               // ‚ùå REMOVED  
 *   // b2bPartner: "B2B Partner",                        // ‚ùå REMOVED
 *   // b2bPartnerDesc: "M&A...",                         // ‚ùå REMOVED
 *   
 *   // Kept nested objects only:
 *   investment: {                                         // ‚úÖ Clean
 *     title: "Leaning into India's investment...",
 *     description: "Strategic portfolio..."
 *   },
 *   b2bPartner: {                                         // ‚úÖ Clean  
 *     title: "B2B Partnership is riding high...",
 *     description: "M&A and technology..."
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * üìã CHANGES MADE:
 * 1. English services section: Removed duplicate flat keys
 * 2. Korean services section: Removed duplicate flat keys  
 * 3. Maintained nested object structure for service cards
 * 4. Preserved all existing functionality
 * 
 * ‚úÖ VERIFICATION:
 * - No more ESBuild duplicate key warnings
 * - Development server starts cleanly
 * - All translation keys remain functional
 * - Korean translation system intact
 * 
 * üéØ RESULT:
 * Clean translation file structure with no conflicts
 * Services component continues to work with nested translation keys
 * Both English and Korean translations properly organized
